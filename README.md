To display a content of your choice, simply drop the desired files in the `content/` directory.
Because Mohawks is designed as a web server, all `index.html` files will be automatically displayed when their containing folder is requested.

## File Explorer

We have implemented a basic file explorer in the server, it allows you to browse through the `content/` directory and open all types of files and folders.

The operating is simple: if an `index.html` file is located in the requested folder, it will be delivered. Otherwise, the file explorer will index all entries contained in it and display them in a *nice and fresh* presentation including their last modification date and size.

Just click on a link to access it or on the curved left arrow to go to the previous directory.
